### Seth’s list of things that Zoom will revolutionize

1. **Timing**. Traditionally we honor the people who are late by not starting the meeting on time. We never host a meeting that is 3-4 minutes long. People have invested to much time in getting to the meeting.
2. **Commuting**. Commuting goes away, either for some meetings or for all. The purpose of the office is to be with the other people that you exchange ideas with. Used properly, Zoom can be used for this. Zoom removes the barriers of time and space.
3. **The size of the group**. Phone calls have a natural limit to how many people can be on them. Their limiting factor is that we can’t see the other people. We can’t catch the signals. Some people use Zoom as a display of power. They mandate 20 people to be in the meeting, and then use all the time to make their own voice heard. For real participation in a meeting they could use break out rooms, shared docs etc.
4. **Multi-modal**. On a phone call you can talk. On a video all you can talk, see other people, chat, use shared docs etc. All at the same time. 
5. **Side conversation** doesn’t have to detract from the larger purpose of the meeting.
6. **Break-out rooms** change the rhythm of how things work.
7. **Video** is incredibly powerful at weaving the culture. Zoom is a poor substitute for being physically together. But it is a substitute. Participants can choose to radiate energy and cultural values in those meetings. Organise zoom meetings with intent.
8. **Asynchronous**. Synchronous, butts in chairs, is a way to control people. To make sure that they do what they are told to. What they are supposed to do. With asynchronous people’s time is freed up Synchronous is a way to display power.
9. **Recording**. What happens when meeting ”goes on the record”. When we can apply machine learning to them to understand what works and what doesn’t.
10. **Translation**. Video can be translated live using computers. That means that it’s available to everyone, everywhere.
11. **Transcription**. With transcripted content everything that has been said is searchable. It can be archived and found.
12. **Computer aware**. With transcription we can leverage computers to help and teach us during meetings. 
13. **Triggers**. How can we leverage that a computer can listen to what we are saying and react to it? It can show everyone that presentation that is hidden somewhere, right on time.
14. **Gamification**. How can we use this to apply gamification to the workday. If we can figure out what the proper metrics are, they why don’t we apply those metrics as a game? Why can’t we get stats on how many people keeps the meeting in focus during Zoom meetings? Why can’t people report when someone is talking too much?
15. **It’s always on**. Drop-in, drop-out of always on, water-cooler kind of rooms.
16. **It scales to free**. (Like everything on the internet). Once it’s free it becomes widely adopted and the network effects become ever more important. 
17. **Commonplace**. Like it was crazy in 1985 to not have a phone, it will be crazy in ”the future” to not use this kind of methodology. We will look back at the time when we spent 2 hours a day commuting to get to the office, just for the ”pleasure” of being physically close to some people for a few hours of work, like crazy.
18. **The long tail**. You can interact with everyone, everywhere. You can interact with people you actually share something with. Not only people you work with.

Zoom is the dynamic of our future. To figure out how to be great at it, and to make other people great at it, will be a winner.
