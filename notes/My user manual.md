# My user manual
*This is meant as a short guide to who I am and how I operate. You should use this as a starting point for our relationship, not as a definite blueprint of who I am. If you know about the [[Johari window]], you know that this only represents my arena. I have many idiosyncrasies that I’m not aware of. Please point them out to me when you discover them. This is meant to be a living document that updates as I learn new things about myself and the world.*

### My style
* I’m a happy, positive person. Whenever I face hardship our challenges, I try to find solutions.
* I’m a ”trust by default” kind of person, but if my trust in you is shaken it is hard to rebuild. You’ll lose my trust by not following the norms that we have agreed upon, by not following through, by treating others with disrespect, or by hiding information from me.
* I believe in [[Leader-to-leader leadership]]. That means that I expect you to be a leader in your capacity, making decisions, and taking lead in the areas and tasks where you excel. I want to be an agent in that process, not a gatekeeper.
* I have high expectations of people. I also work hard to support people in meeting them. I believe that people will grow and develop when they are given freedom and responsibility, have the right set of tools at hand, and assignments that stretch their ability. [[In the end, it's all about making sure that we get the result we need]]

### What I value
* I believe that [[Communication is the key to everything we do]]. Transparency is one of my most important values. It might seem like corporate BS, but to me, it is important that everything that can be shared, should be shared.
* I value initiative and resourcefulness. If something is bothering you, make it your job to fix it instead of complaining about it. I’d rather hear you say ”I intend to…!” than ”Can I…?”.
* [[Work-life harmony is more important than work-life balance]]. I encourage you to employ strategic self-care to become the most productive and happy version of you possible. Be that exercise, time in nature, meditation, or whatever else you prefer. If you need to leave the office early, or come in late, to make sure that you can do the best work possible, then you should do it.
* Always keep your team in the loop with what's going on for you. They are the ones you should ultimately be accountable to, as they are the ones who will pick up your slack if you go missing.

### What I don’t have patience for
* Don’t hide information from me or the team. [[Communication is the key to everything we do]]
* If you realize that you’ve made a mistake or that something is going off the rails, tell me as soon as possible. [[Everything is an opportunity to learn]].
* I hate when people say [[That's not my job]].
* [[Grudges are poison]] to teamwork. If you have an issue with something I expect you to be open about it and work to resolve it. I'll help you forward as long as you tell me.

### What success looks like to me
* Success starts with setting clear goals. If you don't know where you're going, it's impossible to know when you get there. It doesn't matter if you use SMART goals, OKRs, or something else. As long as your goals are clear, you're good to go.
* When you have committed to a goal, execute with everything you've got to get there. If we miss the target we can recover later. [[Commit, execute, recover]].
* [[Everything is an opportunity to learn]]. Mistakes and failures should be celebrated for what they are. Opportunities to improve. As long as you have a learners mindset, there's no failure

### How to best communicate with me
* I enjoy data-driven arguments that have a story-telling element. I’m easily bored by slides decks filled with text and numbers, and I have a hard time appreciating presentations that aren't well prepared.
* I value honesty, vulnerability and authenticity. If I say something you don’t agree with, tell me straight up. I cherish every person and moment that challenges me in a thoughtful and constructive way.
* When I believe in something I’ll argue hard for it. Don't be scared off by it. I will appreciate you for arguing for what you believe in.
* I'm usually available on Slack, but I turn it off or put it in DND mode when I need to focus. If you need to contact me urgently off-hours, the phone is the most reliable alternative. I'm one of the people who actually listen to my voice messages.

### How I make decisions
* It is important to me that every opinion is heard before a decision is made.
* I believe that most decisions should be made by the team. Sometimes we can't find a solution that everyone agrees on. When that happens I expect people to [[Disagree and commit]].
* [[Very few decisions are irreversible]]. The 70% correct decision today is better than the 90% correct decision tomorrow. I don't dwell on decisions but rather look to improve them over time.

### How to help me
* My natural tendency is to give you a lot of responsibility and freedom. If you need more direct guidance, tell me how I can help you in a better way.
* I'm a problem solver at heart. At the same time I believe that [[A leader should be a coach, not a problem-solver]]. Sometimes I might try to solve your problems, even if you don't need me to. When that happens, tell me to step out of problem-solver mode.

### What people misunderstand about me
* Since I’m always trying to involve and engage people some might think I shy away from making decisions. If needed I’ll make the call, but I’m sure that the individual or the team will be better off if they can make their own decisions.
* I firmly believe in empathy and compassion, but don't confuse that with me not expecting your best effort at every turn. Few things frustrate me as much as people that don't live up to their potential.
