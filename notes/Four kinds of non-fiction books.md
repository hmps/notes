There are tree kinds of non-fiction books. Narrative book, tree books, branch books, and hybrid books. The importance of categories like these is that it helps you pick books to read. It also affects how you read a book, and what you should expect from it.

# Narrative books
Books that tell a story. Examples are biographies, memoirs, and historic books. There might still be learnings in them, but the main purpose of the book is to tell the story.

# Tree books
Books that lay out the foundation for a whole system of thinking in a particular field. A good example is [[BOOK: Thinking Fast and Slow]]. Kahneman lays out his entire lifes work around behavioural economics in it. It's a **tree** of knowledge, layed out in a single book.

## Examples
* [[BOOK - Thinking Fast and Slow]]
* [[BOOK - Principles]]
* [[BOOK - High output management]]

# Branch books
Branch books are books that stem from a **Tree book**. They dive into a specific topic from a tree book and explore it more fully, and possibly from a different angle, than the original book. They consist of a single idea, and use the entire book to explore them.

A branch book can often be summarized in a single sentence.

## Examples

* [[BOOK - Radical candor]] is a branch book from [[BOOK - High output management]]

# Hybrid books
Hybrid books are books that combine the storytelling parts of a **narrative book** with the conveying of ideas from a tree or branch book. [[The Hard Thing About Hard Things- Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers]] is an example.

# How to read the different categories

* **Tree books** should be carefully, word by word. Stop after every chapter and think about it. Try to summarize it and really dig in on the the point it tries to deliver. Tree books can not be summarized in a good way
* **Branch books** can be skimmed. As a [HBR article](https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-read-a-book-a-week) laid out about reading a book a week:
	1. Check out the authors bio online. That will give you an idea of their biases and perspectives.
	2. Read the title, subtitle, front flap, back cover and table of contents.
	3. Read the introduction and conclusion word for word. This will give you an idea of where the author is coming from and where they ended up.
	4. Read/skim each chapter. Read the title, the first few paragraphs, the conclusions. Think about how it fits into the bigger argument that the author is trying to make. Skim headings and subheadings. Read the first and last sentence of each paragraph. Once you understand the argument, feel free to move on.
	5. Read the table of contents again. Make sure that you understand the main points of each chapter, and the book. If you don't, rinse and repeat.
* **Narrative book** should be read like a tree book.
* **Hybrid books** needs to be assessed on how they are written. Some of them can be skimmed, while others needs to be read in full.
