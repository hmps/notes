# Performance at work MOC
Performance is a critical piece of the success of a company. When the people of a company are performing well, so is the company. We spend a lot of time and effort tracking how the company is doing. We should spend the same amount of time tracking how people are doing.

How is performance different from development?

# Principles
* [[Employees should own their own performance development]]
* The company needs to support it's people (including leaders) to enable them to handle the responsibility.
* Everybody needs a growth mindset
* Performance reviews ties into compensation reviews. But they are separate.
* 1:1 is the smallest unit of performance and development

# Goal-setting frameworks
One of the corner stones of being able to track performance is to set clear goals.

## OKRs

## Smart goals

# Tools
* A survey tool is vital. It can be something as simple as Google Forms. It has to be easy to use and every employee has to know how to use it.
* A tool to track goals and performance.
* A tool to prepare, conduct, review, and follow-up on meetings
* A cadence for meetings, and a system that alerts and reminds people to have it.

# Training needed
* How to achieve a growth mindset
* Structured surveys
* Solicit feedback from peers
* Schedule tough conversations
