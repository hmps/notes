# Be deliberate with your communication
The Finnish professor [Osmo Wiio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmo_Antero_Wiio) formulated [Wiio’s laws](http://jkorpela.fi/wiio.html) in the 1970s. It can be thought of as a version of [Murphy’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law), centered on communication and human connection. The fundamental point in Wiio’s laws is that:

> **Communication usually fails, except by accident**  
Communication can fail for any number of reasons. Here’s a short short list of examples that you might recognize from your communication with colleagues.

### Language differences
We all communicate it English. For some, it’s their native language. For others, it’s their third language. Some have an extensive academic background, some have no higher education.
### Cultural differences
Whatever you assume about the recipient(s) of you message, they are wrong in some way. What you intended as a neutral statement will be interpreted as horrendous blasphemy and beautiful poetry by different people.

### Personal differences
Assumptions about prior knowledge of the topic, communication preferences, and even current state of mind. They are all factors that will impact how the recipient understands your message.

* To have any chance for successful communication it’s crucial to be deliberate!
* Make your communication low-context. That means that each piece of communication should be able to stand on it's own. Don't assume that the receiver has a certain prior knowledge or that they know what you know.
* Make it very clear what your opinions are, and what the facts are. Don't try to put your opinions forward as hard facts, it will only irritate people. [[To lead you have to be assertive]], but to communicate effectively it's often better to state your opinions and ask questions.
* Remember that you communicate with a person about a topic. Write *to* that person. And write *about* the topic. Not the other way around.
* Written text poses it's own set of challenges. One of them is the ability to convey tone and meaning. Emojis can be a tool to make written communication more effective to you. Use them deliberately and when needed. They are fine to use in a business context too. You might want to stay away from the poop emoji, but a tone indicating smiley works just fine!
