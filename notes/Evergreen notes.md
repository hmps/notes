# Evergreen notes
These are the "highest level" of notes. They are long-lasting, low-context, and have a value on their own.

They have increasingly complex levels of development
- They are born as stubs, often defined via backlinks from [[Transient notes]]
- They evolve into simple definitions of terms and concepts. At this point, I'm starting to add some of my own thinking on the concept at hand.
- With some more work they become precise and declarative notes. They are low-context and can stand on their own. I have probably fleshed out a lot of my own thoughts about the topic at this point.

[[Prefer note titles with complete phrases]]
- There might be an even higher level here. Notes that span over multiple other Evergreen notes and that becomes even broader collections of concepts.
