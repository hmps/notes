# Behaviour is created by pushing and restraining forces
There are pushing and restraining forces to behaviour. You can influence people by adding to the pushing forces but it's often more efficient to remove restraining forces instead. Mental image: object in equilibrium between coiled springs. Pushes on the one side, restraints on the other. If you add a pushing force it will create a new equilibrium with higher tension in the system. If you remove a restraint it will produce a new equilibrium with less tension in the system.

To create a culture you need to promote certain behaviours. Because [[Culture is not a set of shared beliefs, it's a set of shared actions]]. What restraining forces can you remove to make the desired behaviours easier?

If someone is behaving like A and you think they should behave like B instead - ask them why they aren't already behaving like B.
