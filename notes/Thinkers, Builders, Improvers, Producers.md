## Notes
There are only four jobs: 

### Thinkers
Thinkers are visionaries, strategists, creators. All the big ideas start with them. Their best work is in creating new products, new business ideas, and different ways of going everyday things.

these are the strategists, creators of new products, those that come up with big ideas and new ways of doing things.

### Builders
Builders take an idea from scratch and create something tangible from it. Entrepreneurs, inventors, turn-around executives, deal-makers and project managers are typical jobs that require a strong Builder component.

these are the people who take these ideas and convert them into something tangible.

### Improvers
Improvers upgrade, change or make repeatable processes better. Managers are typically required to do this kind of work. To continually monitor and improve processes under their responsibility. Improvers can be IC’s or managers of teams and projects.

these people improve whatever has been created and built, and make it better.

### Producers
Producers execute or maintain a repeatable process. They typically require training or advanced skills to be in a position to execute the process. Their work can range from simple things like working in inbound help desk, to more complex things like producing a monthly financial report or writing code.

these are the people who deliver high quality products and services to the customer.

Every person is a mix of all four types, with one or two being dominant. Every job is also a mix of all four types, with one or two being the main requirement. When selecting people for a new job it’s vital to get this match right. That starts by understanding the position, the other people on the team, the objectives of the team etc.

As a company grows and gets more mature, more work gets done by producers and improvers. But without a culture of consistent improvement, the producers will take over and make changing things ever slower. Thinkers and builders will already have left for some new venture. Improvers will follow them, and start hiring producers to bring some order to the newly created chaos. The old producers, who aren’t up for continuous improvement , will be the only ones left. Maintaining balance across all four types in a constant and necessary struggle of every company to grow, adapt and survive.
