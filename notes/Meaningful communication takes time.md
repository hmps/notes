# Meaningful communication takes time
Time is on your side. Rushing headfirst into a conversation makes it worse. We've all experienced the conversations and conflicts that we look back on and think—”I should have said X”.

To write something up forces you to think things true, solidifies your argumentation, and makes your thoughts clearer. Take the time to write it up. It will end up saving you time in the end.

Don’t expect people to get back to you immediately unless it’s a true emergency. As Basecamp puts it:

> The expectation of immediate response is toxic. Urgency is overrated, ASAP is poison.
