	* However, a resolute and resourceful [[leader]] understands that there are a multitude of means to increase the probability of success. And that’s what it all comes down to, namely, intelligently and relentlessly seeking solutions that will increase
	* your chance of prevailing in a competitive environment. When you do that, the score will take care of itself.
	* MY FIVE DOS FOR GETTING BACK INTO THE GAME:
		* 
			1. Do expect defeat. It’s a given when the stakes are high and the competition is working ferociously to beat you. If you’re surprised when it happens, you’re dreaming; dreamers don’t last long.
		* 
			2. Do force yourself to stop looking backward and dwelling on the professional “train wreck” you have just been in. It’s mental quicksand.
		* 
			3. Do allow yourself appropriate recovery—grieving—time. You’ve been knocked senseless; give yourself a little time to recuperate. A keyword here is “little.” Don’t let it drag on.
		* 
			4. Do tell yourself, “I am going to stand and fight again,” with the knowledge that often when things are at their worst you’re closer than you can imagine to success. Our Super Bowl victory arrived less than sixteen months after my “train wreck” in Miami.
		* 
			5. Do begin planning for your next serious encounter. The smallest steps—plans—move you forward on the road to recovery. Focus on the fix.
	* MY FIVE DON’TS:
		* 
			1. Don’t ask, “Why me?”
		* 
			2. Don’t expect sympathy.
		* 
			3. Don’t bellyache.
		* 
			4. Don’t keep accepting condolences.
		* 
			5. Don’t blame others.
	* It began with this fundamental leadership assertion: Regardless of your specific job, it is vital to our team that you do that job at the highest possible level in all its various aspects, both mental and physical (i.e., good talent with bad attitude equals bad talent).
	* It is a conceptual blueprint for action; that is, a perception of what should be done, when it should be done, and why it should be done. Your philosophy is the single most important navigational point on your leadership compass.
	* The Walsh Standard
Exhibit a ferocious and intelligently applied work ethic directed at continual improvement;
demonstrate respect for each person in the organization and the work he or she does;
be deeply committed to learning and teaching, which means increasing my own expertise;
be fair;
demonstrate character;
honor the direct connection between details and improvement, and relentlessly seek the latter;
show self-control, especially where it counts most—under pressure; demonstrate and prize loyalty;
use positive language and have a positive attitude;
take pride in my effort as an entity separate from the result of that effort;
be willing to go the extra distance for the organization;
deal appropriately with victory and defeat, adulation and humiliation (don’t get crazy with victory nor dysfunctional with loss);
promote internal communication that is both open and substantive (especially under stress);
seek poise in myself and those I lead;
put the team’s welfare and priorities ahead of my own;
maintain an ongoing level of concentration and focus that is abnormally high;
make sacrifice and commitment the organization’s trademark.
	* That is the measure, in my opinion, of any great organization, including a team of football players—that willingness to sacrifice for the team, to go the extra mile, the extra five or fifty miles. And it starts with the leader and your leadership staff.
	* The leader’s job is to facilitate a battlefield-like sense of camaraderie among his or her personnel, an environment for people to find a way to bond together, to care about one another and the work they do, to feel the connection and extension so necessary for great results. Ultimately, it’s the strongest bond of all, even stronger than money.
	* The culture precedes positive results. It doesn’t get tacked on as an afterthought on your way to the victory stand. Champions behave like champions before they’re champions; they have a winning standard of performance before they are winners.
	* It’s similar to a wave that gathers force for many miles out at sea and eventually crashes down with tremendous power on the beach.
	* “What assets do we have right now that we’re not taking advantage of?”
	* they got the cat down from the tree. During all the congratulations afterward, the fire truck drove off and ran over the cat.
	* A leader must never quit.
		* 
			2. A leader must know when to quit.
		* 
			3. Proving that you are right or proving that someone is wrong are bad reasons for persisting.
		* 
			4. Good logic, sound principles, and strong belief are the purest and most productive reasons for pushing forward when things get rough.
	* You must
		* Be committed to excellence.
		* Be positive.
		* Be prepared. (Good luck is a product of good planning.)
		* Be detail-oriented.
		* Be organized.
		* Be accountable.
		* Be near-sighted and far-sighted.
		* Be fair.
		* Be firm.
		* Be flexible.
		* Believe in yourself.
		* Be a leader.
	* Sharp Pencils Do Not Translate into Sharp Performance
	* Of course, it’s an easy trap to fall into, because the trivialities I noted are typical of what a desperate leader can grab onto and control when everything seems out of control.
	* “Commit, explode, recover (if you’re wrong)!” [[Commit, execute, recover]]
	* Leadership is expertise. It is not rhetoric or cheerleading speeches.
		* 
			1. We can win if we work smart enough and hard enough.
		* 
			2. We can win if we put the good of the group ahead of our own personal interests.
		* 
			3. We can win if we improve. And there is always room for improvement.
		* 
			4. I know what is required for us to win. I will show you what it is.
	* you don’t need to shout, stomp, or strut to be a great leader—just do the job and treat people right. Isn’t that an essential element in getting people to trust and follow you?
	* They need sunshine and water.
	* “Don’t mistake activity for achievement.”
	* If you’re Jerry Rice, the greatest receiver in NFL history and, according to some, the greatest player, you’re practicing a slant pass pattern at 6 A.M. over and over with nobody within a mile of you—no football, no quarterback, nobody but Jerry working to improve, to master his profession. Why is the NFL’s greatest-ever receiver doing this? Jerry Rice understands the connection between preparation and performance; between intelligently applied hard work and results; between mediocrity and mastery of your job. And Jerry has the skill coupled with the will to do it. Joe Montana, perhaps the greatest quarterback in NFL history, in his last season as a professional, when he was playing for Kansas City, would spend two hours a day every day at the same little practice field at Menlo College near San Francisco. I would work with him on basic fundamentals that would bore a high schooler to death. Joe had four Super Bowl rings. How did he get them? Why was he on that little practice field? Joe Montana understands what mastery means. You never stop learning, perfecting, refining—molding your skills. You never stop depending on the fundamentals—sustaining, maintaining, and improving. Jerry and Joe, maybe the best ever at their positions, at the last stages of their careers were still working very hard on the fundamental things that high school kids won’t do because it’s too damn dull. It wasn’t dull to Jerry and Joe, because they understood the
	* absolute and direct connection between intelligently directed hard work and achieving your potential. We all do; you do; I do. Everybody who’s a serious player knows what it takes. The difference is how much you’re willing to give to get there. For us, there is no mystery to mastery. And it applies to football players and coaches, general managers and executives in sports or business. It applies to anyone anywhere who wants to get really good—who wants to master his or her profession. It applies to you.
	* Afford each person the same respect, support, and fair treatment you would expect if your roles were reversed. Deal with people individually, not as objects who are part of a herd—that’s the critical factor. 2. Leadership involves many people, each with their own need for role identity within the organization. Find what a person does best, utilize and emphasize it, and steer clear of his or her weaknesses. 3. Demonstrate a pronounced commitment to employees by providing a work environment that enables them to achieve their maximum potential and productivity. 4. Acknowledge the uniqueness of each employee and the need he or she has for a reasonable degree of job security and self-actualization. You don’t own him or her. 5. The most talented personnel often are very independent minded. This requires that you carefully consider how you relate to and communicate with this type of individual. Creative people usually bring a passion to seeing their ideas put into play as quickly as possible. They must be
