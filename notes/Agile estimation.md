# Agile estimation
Agile estimation is all about delivering value early. As humans we are terrible at doing absolute estimates. That is, to say how long a specific task will take. We're pretty good at relative estimates. That is, how much effort a task will be in relation to another task.

Before an iteration the development team estimates the effort it will take to complete the tasks something, using story points. Find the easiest task in the backlog, and assign it a story point. Always use a Fibonacci number, as they sum up nicely. Find the hardest task, and assign it a value. Assign all the tasks story points.

Customers assign value points in a similar manner.

Bang for the buck points are `story points / value points`. Use BFTB to order the work going into the iteration.

As the team goes trough iterations, track how many story points they are able to deliver. That is the velocity of the team. Also track the value points delivered. The delivered value should be really high in the beginning and drop of as the project proceeds. At some point the customer might want to call the project as finished, when the delivered value no longer justifies the investment.
