# Writing helps everyone, speaking only helps the people there with you
When you express your thoughts, you give others the opportunity to understand your perspective and background. Your opinions, thoughts and feelings are one of the reasons why you work here. They are critical to make us better!

When you express yourself synchronously to a group of people, you only extend that opportunity to the people “in the room”. When you express yourself through an async channel, you give the same opportunity to everyone that you share the content with.

For the times when synchronous, spoken language is the right tool for the job—record it and share the video later. That way you can unlock time for others, just like with async. Remember that the findability of video isn’t as good as of text. Also remember that we’re on a mission to change that.
