# Culture is not a set of shared beliefs, it's a set of shared actions
You don't have to believe it to act it. And if you act it you build it.  An old coach of mine used to say "fake it till you make it". If you can't be successful for real, fake it. If you can't be happy for real, fake it. If you behavior is consistent, your results will be too.

It's the same with culture. A culture is worth nothing if you believe in it but doesn't act accordingly. And you don't have to believe in a culture to foster it. You just have to match your actions with it.
