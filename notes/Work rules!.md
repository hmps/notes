# Notes
## Culture
* To create a winning culture you need to have a mission, be transparent, and trust and listen to your people.
* If you're not nervous, you haven't given your people enough freedom.
* [[Culture exists in artifacts, values, and the assumptions that underpin them]]. How does this relate to [[Culture is not a set of shared beliefs, it's a set of shared actions]]?
* Poka-yoke (mistake proofing). Failing to fasten your seatbelts causes an alarm to go off. Failing to behave as prescribed could do the same.
* Be frugal and generous. Give as much as you can to keep your people efficient, innovative and happy. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money.
* Manage rising expectations. Instill a culture of experimentation, in your product as well as in your culture. Let people know that you are testing benefits for a few months. Evaluate and move on.
* [[Everybody should have a founders mindset]]
* Be open to everyone's crazy ideas and find a way to say yes!

### Mission
Give meaning to the work. The missions should give a moral (not commercial) meaning to your people's work. It's important to try to craft it without a ceiling. For example, Google's mission is "Collect all the world's information". That can never be accomplished, and it will forever serve as a motivator to find new ways to collect information.

### Managers
Managers should lead projects, clear roadblocks and inspire people. That's it. Hiring is done by groups, promotion is done by groups, awards and recognition is done by groups.

A roadblock might be that the team is not able to decide on a matter. It's then the managers responsibility to make the call. There has to be a hierarchy in decision making.

Review and evaluate your managers. [[Project Oxygen]]

### Promotions and recognition
* Use data for everything. If you don't have the data, collect it.
* Celebrate thoughtful failure!
* How do you climb the career ladder? What rungs are on it? Google only have four rungs. Individual contributor, manager, director and vice president. There's also a parallel track for IC's who want to remain so. Progression as an IC is a function of a person's scope, impact and leadership.
* Calibration is essential. But avoid stack ranking at all cost!
* Use peers to understand how people are doing. A simple survey (with structured data collection) will give you a lot of information.

### Changing behavior
Use nudging to influence how people behave. [[Things to remember|Culture is not a set of shared beliefs, it's a set of shared behaviors]].

Run an annual event to fix the frustrations at the company.

Let your people fix  their own problems. If there is limited time or money, tell them what the limitations are.

## Communication
Be transparent and avoid backstabbing. If someone sends you a message about someone else, CC that person and solve the issue.

## Hiring
Hiring is the most important activity that you do. Without excellent hiring, you need to spend a lot of time and money training. Never compromise on quality of hires.

Success is highly contextual. You need to identify what makes people successful in your context, and hire people that share the same traits.

Make recruiting everyone's job. Everybody should spend time on in, every week. Sourcing candidates, interviews, etc.

Final say on recruiting should lie with a central reviewer. It can be someone (or a group) from senior leadership.

Resilience, ability to overcome obstacles, general cognitive ability, emergent leadership, and culture fit. Those are what Google checks for when they hire.

Emergent leadership is a form of leadership that ignores formal designations. Over a team's life, different skills will be needed at different times. Various people will have to step in (and out) of roles (including leadership). It's as important to step into a role as it is to step back out of it. [[Micro roles]]

Use structured interviews. Ask all candidates a predefined and consistent set of questions, and have clear criteria for how to assess their response. Not every interviewer have to review all attributes. All attributes have to be reviewed by at least two interviewers.

## Training
Focus on the two tails of your employees. The top 5 percent and the bottom 5.
Find your best employees. Let them teach.
Find your worst employees (bottom 5 percent). Tell them that you've found them. Teach them.

Train for small changes. Broad, sweeping training is doomed to fail.

*Atomic habits seems to be a concept that could be used to train people. What is the thing we want them to develop? How do we take steps to change the behavior?*

Use nudging to change the behavior of you people.

Collect data about your training. Reaction, learning, behavior, and results are the three traits that you should measure. **Follow up on training**

## Performance
* Performance follows a power law distribution. Being average is not bad, it's just math.
* Don't confuse development with managing performance.

## Compensation
* Pay unfairly. You have people that are 5x better than others. Compensate them accordingly.

*This is in sharp contrast with the predictable model of compensation that Buffer et al uses. How does each model perform? They both speak of the value of **fairness**, but approach it differently.*

* Reward people using experiences and things instead of money. It means more to them!
* Have programs in place that delight and cares for your employees. Why do you run these programs? At Google it's to further efficiency, community and innovation. (Dry cleaning, sell lunch etc)
* Pay your best people in a way that incentives them to stay. Stock options etc.

## Innovation
Innovation happens in the structural holes between social groups. This can be gaps between team that doesn't work together often, or people that usually doesn't make their voice heard in a group. Ronald Burr, at the University of Chicago puts it like: "People who stand near the holes in a social network are at higher risk of having good ideas." People with tight social networks often have similar ideas and ways of looking at problems. Over time this leads to a decline in creativity. People who operate in the space between groups tend to come up with better ideas.

### WORK RULES
* Choose to think of yourself as a founder. Now act like one.
* Think of your work as a calling, with a mission that matters.

* If you’re not nervous, you haven’t given them enough.
* Given limited resources, invest your HR dollars first in recruiting.
* Hire only the best by taking your time, hiring only people who are better than you in some meaningful way, and not letting managers make hiring decisions for their own teams.
