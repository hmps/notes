The analogy between a company and the military is old, and somewhat diluted. It’s also really good. The growth of a company and a military operation both requires strategy, tactics, supply lines, alliances, communication, manpower, etc. 

### Commandoes
Commandoes are brilliant, awe-inspiring people. They quietly crawl ashore during the protection of darkness. Speed is their strongest weapons. They work fast, hard and cheap. Their job is to do the most amount of damage within a short timeframe. Their job is to establish a beach-head before the opposition even know that they are there.

Software commandoes work in undefined markets and build things that look and behave like a product. But it usually isn’t a product because it still has major flaws and bugs that goes unnoticed to commando types. Or it might work fine and have no way of scaling or be produced in a profitable way. Commandoes are useless for this kind of work. They’ll get bored and start looking for new territories to conquer.

### Infantry
Infantry soldiers are brilliant, awe-inspiring people. They are the people who hit the beach with numbers. They are the people who slog out the early victories, building on the start given by the commandoes. They take the position that the commandoes have established and they refine it, protects it, and turns it into a suitable point of launch. Not only do they come in numbers, they also bring multi a great variation of skills and competencies. And because of the sheer size of their operation they also bring infrastructure, rules and processes. All the stuff that commandoes hate. But that’s okay, because by now the commandoes are bored and are looking to get out.

Software infantry builds real products in growing markets. They know how to build processes around development, how to analyse the market, how to listen to customers and create iterative loops. They will start educating the customers, make sure that they have feature differentiation and that what they are building is something that a lot of people will be interested in buying.

Commandoes make success possible, infantry make success happen.

### Police
Police are brilliant, awe-inspiring people. When the infantry has succeeded in turning a new territory into a controlled and regulated zone, they move in. Police hate change. Police hate when other try to upset the order that has been created. Police fuel growth by adding people and building economies. They build economies of scale and order.

Software police works in mature markets to establish metric driven efficiency. They deal with high volume, standardised and stable business. They work to keep the cost of operation as low as possible and build only what is needed to ensure continued success.

Infantry makes success happen, police makes success permanent.
