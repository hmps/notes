**Quantum states**
Electrons, that decide what a material is with their position in the world, are always either here or there. They have a specific quantum state. To move between states they either take on or give off energy.

A customer’s quantum state is not a normal distribution. It’s not a bell curve. Consumers flip and flop. Eg, reviews on Amazon are not distributed normally. They are distributed bi-modally. There’s a big chunk of 1-star reviews, and a big chunk of 5-star reviews. Even if most people really are 3-star review, why would they spend the time to leave a 3-star review? Only people who are either trolls and critics, or raving fans, are energised enough to actually take action.

**Customer service is about one of to two things:**
1. Moving a person from ”meh, it’s alright”, to ”I love this”. Or,
2. Save someone who is about to flip their energy from ”meh, it’s alright” to ”I hate this”.

What state is a customer in when we interact with them? 
Like medical triage - what customers will respond to immediate intervention?

Give your customer service people mandate and power! When they identify a customer who’s quantum state is in flux they should work to resolve their issues with all that they have.
