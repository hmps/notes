## Notes
There are two kinds of meetings. Decision-making meetings and meetings for thinking together. If meetings are actually about making decisions, donâ€™t start thinking about that decision in the meeting. Have everyone read up and write down the decision they are in favour of. Before the meeting. Schedule a short meeting to make the final decision.

For thinking-together meetings, make use of useful exercises that forces collaboration. Pre-mortem, brainstorming, etc.
