# Employees should own their own performance development
At [Spotify](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1321755439/13369531) they train employees to take responsibility for their own performance and development. Employees are tasked to schedule performance meetings, to solicit feedback from colleagues, etc.

What Spotify gives them is the training to be able to take this responsibility, and the tools to execute on it. HR doesn't really make an effort to track meetings, follow-ups etc. Instead they train people (employees as well as managers) to understand what the principles behind performance and development are, and what tools they have at their disposal.

This principle is very much in line with the idea that [[Everybody should have a founders mindset]]. If nothing else, people who own their own development act like founders for themselves.

To train all people to have a growth mindset is critical for this.
