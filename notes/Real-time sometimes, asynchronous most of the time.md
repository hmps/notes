# Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time
Real-time means ”right now”. Stop everything else and talk to me right now. Most of the time, that’s not necessary. Asynchronous should be your default mode of communication. That creates [[Space and attention to focus]] on what’s most important right now, including things that need real-time. If everything needs ”right now”, nothing will ever fully get it. Use async channels for thoughtful and deliberate conversations about most things. Leave real-time for the really important things.

[[Meetings should be a last resort]], not a first option. A lot of meetings could have been solved better and more efficiently via a collaborative document. **Communication in general shouldn't require us to schedule synchronization.** Writing, rather than speaking or meeting, isn't dependent of anyone’s schedule, and persists over time. Even when a meeting is required, a meeting that has been prepared in writing before is far better than one that hasn't.
