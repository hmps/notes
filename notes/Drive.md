# Terminology
The three types of motivation
* Motivation 1.0 = survival
* Motivation 2.0 = humans seek our reward and avoid punishment. Stick and carrot.
* Motivation 3.0 = the others are true. But motivation also needs autonomy, mastery and purpose.

Algorithmic tasks (follow a recipe)(left brain) vs heuristic tasks (conceptual learning(?))(right brain), there's no formula to follow).

## Type I and Type X behavior.
* Type I people are motivated by intrinsic factors (mastery, autonomy, purpose).
* Type X people are motivated by external factors (money).
* Behavior isn't static. Type i behavior can be taught.
* Fair rewards are important to both I and X
* Type X behavior is finite (money ends), whereas Type I behavior is more sustainable.

# Motivation 2.0
* Can work perfectly fine for algorithmic tasks.
* Is devastating to heuristic tasks.
* Inner motivation is fuel for creativity. Handling external motivation is harmful for creativity. It often makes people focus on a narrow task instead of a broader scope.
* Goals are a type of external motivation. They need to be used carefully to not cause harm.
* For inner motivation to be able to work, rewards and punishments needs to be fair and predictable. That way they can be put out of mind. If rewards are unfair, people's focus will be on the injustice.

**Principal-agent theory** (Anton Suvorov). A principal (eg a partent) tries to get the agent to perform a certain task. An agent wants to balance their own interest against what the prinicipal offers. By offering a reward for a completed task, the principal signals that the task isn't attractive. They also start down a slope that is hard (impossible) to recover from. If the reward they offer is too small, the agent won't be interested. If it's big enough to make the agent interested, the principal has to offer the same reward the next time they need to task completed. It's even likely that when the joy of the first reward has subsided, the reward needs to be bigger for the agent's motivation to stay the same.

**Sawyer effect** - Work can be turned into play, and play can be turned into work.

External awards should be unexpected, and only given when the task is completed. Instead of "if-then" rewards to "now-that" rewards. *How does this align with the need for fairness?*

# Motivation 3.0
To motivate people to do good work when assigned boring tasks, use this approach:
1. Give a rational explanation to why the task is necessary. Put it in context.
2. Admit that it's a boring job. Show compassion.
3. Let everyone complete the task in their own way. Be clear about the result you're looking for.

The most important freedom for creatives is the freedom to experiment. Innovation might seem expensive, but in the long run it's cheap. Being average is expensive.

## Autonomy
Autonomy is required to be able to achieve flow. The relationship between what a person can do and what they are asked to do is also important. The task can't be to easy or to hard. It should be one or two steps above the persons current ability. These are called Goldilock tasks (neither too hot or too cold)

* Autonomy in tasks - people get to decide what they are working on themselves
* Autonomy in time - people get to decide how much time, and when, they spend on a task
* Autonomy in technique - people can use the technique they prefer to get the job done
* Autonomy in teams - people can chose who to work with

## Mastery
Flow is required for mastery. But flow doesn't guarantee mastery. They operate on different time horizons. Flow is in the present, mastery occurs over months and years.

Mastery is a way of approaching work. *Perpetual learning.* *Growth mindset*.

Static/fixed mindset vs growth mindset. A growth mindset is needed to work towards mastery.

Handling set backs can be done in two ways. "Helpless" or "geared towards mastery". You either learn from set backks

## Purpose
People who are motivated link their work and desire to something bigger than themselves. The mission of the company.
