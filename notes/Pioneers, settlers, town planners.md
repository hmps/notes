There is no such thing as IT, development or finance. There are multiple of each. Multiple ways of doing IT, and each has it strengths, culture, and type of person. To allow people to gain **mastery** in one of these three domains will make them happier and more focus. A company needs brilliant people in all three areas. Three cultures, three groups, each one has go excel at what it does.

Each team needs to steal from the ones earlier in the value chain. Eg. The settlers need to steal from the pioneers. That will force the pioneers to move on.

### Pioneers
**Pioneers** are brilliant people. They are able to explore never before discovered concepts, the uncharted land. They show you wonder but they fail a lot. Half the time the thing doesn’t work properly. You wouldn’t trust what they build. They create ’crazy’ ideas. Their type of innovation is what we call core research. They make future success possible. Most of the time we look at them and go ”what?”, ”I don’t understand?” and ”is that magic?”. In the past, we often burnt them at the stake. They built the first ever electric source (the Parthian Battery, 400AD) and the first ever digital computer (Z3, 1943).

### Settlers
**Settlers** are brilliant people. They can turn the half baked thing into something useful for a larger audience. They build trust. They build understanding. They learn and refine the concept. They make the possible future actually happen. They turn the prototype into a product, make it manufacturable, listen to customers and turn it profitable. Their innovation is what we tend to think of as applied research and differentiation. They built the first ever computer products (e.g. IBM 650 and onwards), the first generators (Hippolyte Pixii, Siemens Generators).

### Town planners
**Town Planners** are brilliant people. They are able to take something and industrialise it taking advantage of economies of scale. They build the platforms of the future and this requires immense skill. You trust what they build. They find ways to make things faster, better, smaller, more efficient, more economic and good enough. They build the services that pioneers build upon. Their type of innovation is industrial research. They take something that exists and turn it into a commodity or a utility (e.g. with Electricity, then Edison, Tesla and Westinghouse). They are the industrial giants we depend upon.
