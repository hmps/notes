# Communication is the key to everything we do
[We cannot not communicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Watzlawick#Five_basic_axioms). Even saying or doing nothing is a form of communication. Few things are as important to be deliberate, clear and careful with as communication. And few things can make things fall apart as quickly as bad communication.

In other words, how and what we communicate is the key to us being successful. So what can we do to give ourselves the best possible chance of success?

### Some principles that we can follow.
* [[Assume positive intent]]
* [[Be deliberate with your communication]]
* [[Treat others with kindness and respect]]
* [[Meaningful communication takes time]]

### More specific on written communication:
* [[Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time]]
* [[Writing helps everyone, speaking only helps the people there with you]]
* [[Consider where you put your communication]]
