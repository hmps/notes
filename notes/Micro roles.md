# Micro roles
* Every member on a team has several "micro roles".
* Each role is clearly defined, and everybody can access that definition.
* Role definitions include:
	* Title
	* Responsibilities
	* Expectations
* Each role is reviewed at given intervals. Nobody "owns" a role, so everyone can (and should) find ways to improve and evolve roles.
* Holocracy - one person has many roles. They are defined and public. Everybody know what roles I have, what to expect from me in them, and what my obligations are. Everybody can suggest changes to the role or the description of the role.
