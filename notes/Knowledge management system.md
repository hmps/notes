# Knowledge management system
Most people take only [[Transient notes]]. Myself included. The number of highlights that I have made in books and articles are probably enough to fill a book on their own. Yet, they give me little value over time. The logical error here is that notes are given to much value. [[Notes aren't important, thinking is]].

### Reading Inbox
* The first part of the knowledge management system is the [[üìñ READING INBOX]]. This is where I add interesting things that pop up in one of my feeds.
* Triage
	1. **Add interesting thing to inbox.** Make it a todo. It might be added to [[Instapaper]] and linked from there. That supports longevity, one never know what can happen to articles online. **Mark it with today's date.**
	2. Read it and take notes. This might mean making highlights in [[Instapaper]], for example if I'm reading on a tablet or phone. If I'm reading on the computer it probably means writing notes directly in Roam. No matter what, create a new page in Roam. It should be have the same title as the article, and include the "ARTICLES:" metadata section.
	3. If I read and highlighten in Instapaper I will add it to Roam.
	4. Mark the todo as done.
### Taking notes on books, articles, etc
1. I take [[Incomplete notes]] or highlight interesting concepts. I try not to be shy here. I'll come back and weed out the unimportant or superfluous things later. I try to capture the essence of a concept in each highlight. If multiple highlights are needed I make use of the fact that I'll see them as a list later on and be able to connect the dots.
2. Triage, filter and sort the notes. Combine them into fewer and more compressed notes. These notes are probably still [[Incomplete notes]] but has a higher level of complexity than the raw highlights.
3. Find and extract the concepts from the refined notes. Once this step is done I should have reduced the number of notes down to a handful of concepts. Create a stub for an [[Evergreen notes]] for each of them, or add to the existing one if it already exists.

### Writing inbox
* The [[Writing Inbox ‚úçÔ∏è]] is where things end up that I think I want to write more about. It might be a few concepts from a book, or something simpler that I've found in my [[üìñ READING INBOX]].
* I'll probably need a routine to weed out the list here. Maybe I could mark each item every time I look at it / consider it. After a handful of looks it should be obvious that it's not interesting enough.

### Daily notes
* This is where a lot of the [[Transient notes]] originates. Random notes and ideas that I collect throughout the day. I try to tag these as best as I can, they might become part of a stubbed [[Evergreen notes]] or an outline at some point. It's very likely that they won't though.
