The Ellsberg paradox, as it’s called, imagines there are two urns (statisticians love urns), the first with 50 black balls and 50 red balls and the second with 100 balls that are either red or black, but you don’t know how many of each. You are asked to pick a ball from an urn. If it is red, you win $100, if it is black you get nothing. Which urn would you choose from?

Most people prefer to pick from the first urn, the one with the known proportion of red and black balls. They prefer a known probability of winning to an unknown probability. Even more, if they are then given a second chance but told they will win the $100 if they pick a black ball this time, they will still choose from the first urn. They are not reacting to some preconception of how many of each type of ball is in the second urn, because then they would switch on the second bet. They simply prefer the devil they know to the devil they don’t."
