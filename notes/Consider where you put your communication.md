# Consider where you put your communication
The right message in the wrong place might as well not exist at all. When someone has to ask or search to find something, it’s often because it wasn't where they expected it to be.

Know your communication channels, and understand which one to use for your particular need. If you’re unsure where to put something, default to channels that are more asynchronous, and more persistent. You can always take it back later.
