# Work with the garage door open
This is one of my favorite ways to foster real, honest creative work. When people open up their workplace to the public it becomes approachable. It turns it into something that people can participate in and be part of. Instead of opening the garage doors to reveal the new and shiny object, you invite people to take part in, and influence, what you do.

I can think of numerous times when I've worked on the house, or done a work-out on the driveway, or been outside doing some other work that people can see. It has led to me meeting and connecting with many of my neighbors. Workin in the open can help me connect with the people in my physical surroundings, whom I know nothing about and share not expressed purpose with. It seems obvious that bringing the same practice to work would foster more connections, better insights, and more rapid development.

To open the garage door at work we have to be willing to share the messy middle. That part of the work when you're past the "stumbling around" phase, and haven't yet arrived at the "look at this shiny new thing" phase. Where you're still feeling your way forward to understand how to best complete the task at hand.

> I wish starting physical businesses was easier; I wish the path wasn’t so steep, especially in places like the Bay Area; because I think it’s one of the absolute best things a person can do. Among many other things, a physical business enlivens public space, by making the simple, eloquent statement: I am here, working.

> In the same light industrial complex as the Murray Street Media Lab, there’s a woodworking shop, and the man who runs it always keeps his door propped open. Simple as that. What a delight, every damn day, to ride my bike past that door and peek inside and see all his tools, the boards stacked up for whatever commission he’s undertaking. I am here, working.

> Part of the problem of social media is that there is no equivalent to the scientific glassblowers’ sign, or the woodworker’s open door, or Dafna and Jesse’s sandwich boards. On the internet, if you stop speaking: you disappear. And, by corollary: on the internet, you only notice the people who are speaking nonstop.

It would look like that! All the tumult of Twitter would shrink into a single weird cafe—just a speck, in an enormous city made up entirely of people quietly working.*
