# My mentor books
I love books! And I believe that books is one of the greatest mentors a person can have. Whatever problem you're facing, odds are that someone else have solved a version of that problem before. And written a book about their experience.

It's really hard for me to pick my favorite books. There are so many books that I love. I decided to not list more than three in each category. But there are of course other books that have been really influential on me. So when you have read the once below, let me know!

# Leadership and motivation

## Drive
Daniel Pink has written *the* book on how motivation works. This is one of the books that I keep coming back to time after time.

## Mindset
This book by Carol Dweck was able to put words to a concept that I had felt in my gut for the longest time. *With a growth mindset you will never fail again. From here on out, everything that isn't a success is a lesson. And sometimes a lesson is more valuable than success!*

## The score takes care of itself
Bill Walsh is a legendary American football coach. In this book he summarizes his view on leadership. It blew me away when I was a young professional, working to transition from leadership as an athlete to leadership as a coach and manager. And it's excellent even if you know nothing about football!
