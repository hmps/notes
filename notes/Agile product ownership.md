Agile product ownership starts with a vision. The PO is the person who own that vision, who talks about it and makes sure that everyone knows about it.

In a project there are also stakeholders. They have demands on the project. Mostly the demands should be about outcome, but sometimes it can be about output. The PO should push back on that. The PO is responsible for expectation management. The goal is not as much output as possible. It's the desired outcome.

Of course, there is also a development team. Their responsibility is to deliver the desired outcome. They will do so by delivering output, but they need to stay vigilant about **outcome** being the value they are striving for.

The PO sits between the stakeholders and the development team. They facilitate the communication.

Imagine that the stakeholders have 10 new stories every week. The team can deliver 6 stories every week. This means that the backlog will grow all the time, into a never ending list of things to do. One of the PO's most important jobs are to say "no". To keep the backlog sane. Throw things away. If they are important, they will come back.

The PO doesn't do the job of saying "no" all on their own. They facilitate communication between themselves, stakeholders and the team. This communication is the also an important job of the PO.

At the beginning of a project, our guesses of what is valuable and what is hard will suck. That is okey. The important part is the conversation around what we're building. As the project grows more mature, our guesses will be better. To learn and become better at guessing, the team can use [[Agile estimation]].

Passion and communication are the two main things needed to be a successful product owner.

### Trade-offs
It falls on the PO to make trade-offs in the project. The first trade-off is that between different types of value. In a project there are different kinds of risk.

* Business risk (is this the right thing to build)
* Social risk (can the team build this)
* Tech risk (is this the right tech for the job? will it scale?)
* Cost + schedule risk (will we be able to complete this in a timely fashion).

Knowledge is the opposite of risk.

`Value = Knowledge value + Customer value`

Early in a project the team should focus on gaining knowledge. That's why they should do hallway testing, spikes, fail fast etc. As uncertainty becomes less, we start building more value

Another trade-off is to build long-term vs short-term.

The third trade-off is between building the right thing (PO focus), building the thing right (dev team) and building it fast (agile coach).
