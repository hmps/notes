# Better technical hiring process requires cooperative work
Any OSS (or otherwise publicly available work) is a great place to get information about a candidate. If that kind of material isn't available, there needs to be a process to collect the same kind of information. Intel from 3-6 months back in time is what you should be looking for. Anything older is probably not very important anymore, and anything less is to little.

# Process
1. Create a simple code repo and make it private. Give the candidate access to it and tell them that you will be giving them assignments over the next 3-5 days. They are not required to answer immediately, and they should spend no more than 30 minutes on each task. In total they will spend 90-120 minutes in total.
	1. First task is to send me a a few (1-3) questions or observations that they've made about the repo.
	2. Other ideas for tasks:
		* Write documentation about a newly added feature.
		* Review a PR that I've made.
		* Triage and investigate a bug that a customer has submitted
		* Fix a bug and submit a PR.
2. Once you have iterated on the repo for 3-5 days, schedule a short call to give them feedback. Also ask them to provide their observations from the exercise.
3. Attend a standup with the team. They don't have to speak, just listen. After the standup they will spend 3-5 minutes giving me their feedback and observations from the meeting.
4. Pair with a senior member for 30-60 minutes. They should observe and ask questions as the team member is working on an actual task. Again, once it's done they should spend 3-5 minutes giving me their feedback and observations.
5. Attend a team meeting. They don't have to speak, just observe. 3-5 minutes of feedback for me afterwards.
6. Teach me something in 60-90 minutes. It can be anything, code related or not. If they can't think of anything they could take an online course and teach me what they've learned.
7. Final feedback session with the candidate. I want their observations, they can ask me any final questions, and I'll give them my observations and feedback.
8. Collect feedback from everyone who's been involved with the candidate during the process.
