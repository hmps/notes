## Two sentence summary
The most important drivers of a startups value must be uncertain, itâ€™s only this uncertainty that deters larger companies from capturing the value in the market. As a startup you need to seek out uncertainty, navigate the company through it and emerge on the other end with a moat.

## My Notes
* Companies that rely on innovation needs to be comfortable taking risk. Established companies have processes in place that prevents them from investing in projects that has substantial uncertainty. This is the core at why it is possible to disrupt businesses, even when a new, small, and inexperienced company is competing agains a seasoned, large, an experienced incumbent.
* The most important drivers of a startups value creation must be uncertain.
* Competitors are attracted to markets where value is being created. They hope to reap some of that value. Individual companies in that market must keep competition to a minimum in order to succeed. This can be done by digging moats. Patents, exclusive agreements, and regulation are all classical examples of such moats. Moats are expensive and time consuming though. And in the time before the moat is constructed, it is only uncertainty that will deter other companies from trying to capture the value in the market. So to succeed, startups must chose to face uncertainty. Most companies, especially big ones, won't.
* At an established company, one that is willing to take risks, you might be able to propose a project that has a 30% change of a 5x return in 5 years. A rational decision about a project like that, given that it is possible to calculate cost and and expected outcome.
* In a startup environment, you might instead pitch a project that you don't know the probablity of success of, you don't know how long it will take, you don't even know how big it will be if it succeeds. Why don't you know? Because the customers might be different than we think; the product they require might be different than we think; because the market might not even be ready for our product. Etc. The information you need for a "rational" decision, simply doesn't exist.
* To succeed in a startup, you have to seek uncertainty, steer the company through it, and emerge on the other end with a moat. Without risk, there is no way for a startup to exist. Uncertainty creates space and time, but only for a while. As soon as other companies sees that you have a valid strategy for the market, they will come to reap that value as well. When that happens, you need to have constructed your moat.
