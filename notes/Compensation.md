# Compensation
Compensation could be broken up into multiple components
- Base salary. This would be updated once a year based on your role and level. Mostly, this would follow some kind of index (like inflation)
- Performance compensation. Depending on your performance level you are awarded a recurring compensation. Is it related to your role / level?
- Bonus. One-offish compensation for achieving goals etc.
* Pay unfairly. You have people that are 5x better than others. Compensate them accordingly.

*This is in sharp contrast with the predictable model of compensation that Buffer et al uses. How does each model perform? They both speak of the value of **fairness**, but approach it differently.*

* Reward people using experiences and things instead of money. It means more to them!
* Have programs in place that delight and cares for your employees. Why do you run these programs? At Google it's to further efficiency, community and innovation. (Dry cleaning, sell lunch etc)
* Pay your best people in a way that incentives them to stay. Stock options etc.
