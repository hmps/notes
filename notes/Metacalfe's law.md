> The value of a network is equal to the number of users squared.  
Metacalfe's law originally spoke of the effects of telecommunication networks. More users equals a better system. It has later been adapted and used to talk about values in social networks as well. The original law was proved mathematically, but only for the technical part of the network. The social side is more limited since it requires the nodes to be able to communicate, not just to be connected.

For social networks, Metacalfe himself has suggested that the value of the network is `n  log n` instead of `n*n`.
