[We can’t not communicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Watzlawick#Five_basic_axioms). Even saying nothing is a form of communication. Few things are as important to be deliberate, clear and careful with as communication. We do a lot of communication at Docly. Slack, email, documents, Asana, Github. The list goes on. In this article we’re describing how communicate at Docly.

*This section includes specific examples of how we apply our philosophy day-to-day across the company. Since communication often interrupts, valuing each other’s time and attention is a critical consideration. Keeping people in the loop is important, but asking them to follow along with everything is a distraction. That’s why we follow reliable, predictable methods to share the right kind of information at the right time in the right place.*

# Guidelines for respectful and effective communication
1. Assume positive intent
2. Be deliberate
3. Treat other with kindness and respect.
4. Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time.
5. Meaningful communication takes time.
6. Writing helps everyone, speaking only helps the people in the room
7. Consider where you put things.
8. Automate when possible

## 1. Assume positive intent
Try to internalize Hanlon’s [Hanlon’s razor](https://fs.blog/2017/04/mental-model-hanlons-razor/). Most people are not out to get you or put you down. They are simply trying to do their job and live their lives to their best ability. If they write, or say, something that irritates, angers or frustrates you, it’s not because they are trying to do so. They might have a bad day. They might not be deliberate enough in their communication. They might just be a bad communicator. All of which can result in a message that produces a negative feeling inside you.

You can’t control how other people communicate, you can only control how you respond. Assume positive intent, and stay positive, grateful, and humble. Remember that you too will stir similar emotions in other people from time to time.

Be upfront when something you experience negative communication from someone else. Say ”When you write X it makes me feel Y. I assume that you have positive intent, could you please clarify your message for me?”.

## 2. Be deliberate
[A commentary of Wiio’s laws](http://jkorpela.fi/wiio.html)

If your words can be perceived in different ways, they’ll be understood in the way which does the most harm.
He has studied, among other things, readability of texts, organizations and communication within them, and the general theory of communication. His laws of communication are the human communications equivalent of Murphy’s Laws.
[Osmo Wiio: Communication usually fails, except by accident - Signal v. Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com/osmo-wiio--communication-usually-fails--except-by-accident/)

The Finnish professor [Osmo Wiio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmo_Antero_Wiio) formulated [Wiio’s laws](http://jkorpela.fi/wiio.html) in the 1970s. It can be thought of as a version of [Murphy’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law), centered on communication and human connection. The fundamental point in Wiio’s laws is that:

> Communication usually fails, except by accident  
Communication can fail for any number of reasons. Here’s a short short list of examples that you might recognise from your communication with colleagues.

**Language differences**
We all communicate it English. For some, it’s their native language. For others, it’s their third language. Some have an extensive academic background, some have no higher education.

**Cultural differences**
Whatever you assume about the recepient(s) of you message, they are wrong in some way. What you intended as a neutral statement will be interpreted as horrendous blasphemy and beautiful poetry by different people.

**Personal differences**
Assumptions about prior knowledge of the topic, communication preferences, and even current state of mind. They are all factors that will impact how the recipient understands your message.

To have any chance for successful communication it’s crucial to be deliberate!

**Low-context**
**Differ between opinions and facts**
**Write to a person, about a topic**
**Use emojis**

## 3. Treat others with kindness and respect
You’re talking to a person. If even if they are represented by pixels on a screen. Remember that, and talk to them like you sat across a table from them. Sometimes it helps to read your message out loud to help yourself get a feeling for the tone of it.

If you can’t find a way to say something with kindess and respect—don’t say it at all.

## 4. Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time.
Real-time means ”right now”. Stop everything else and talk to me right now. Most of the time, that’s not necessary. Asynchronous should be your default mode of communication. That creates [space and attention to focus](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/23146/too-many-interruptions-work.aspx#1) on what’s most important right now, including things that need real-time. If everything needs ”right now”, nothing will ever fully get it. Use async channels for thoughtful and deliberate conversations about most things. Leave real-time for the really important things.

Meetings should be a last resort, not a first option. A lot of meetings could have been solved better and more efficiently via a collaborative document. Communication in general shouldn’t require us to schedule synchronization. Writing, rather than speaking or meeting, isn’t dependent of anyone’s schedule, and persists over time. Even when a meeting is required, a meeting that has been prepared in writing before is far better than one that hasn’t.

## 5. Meaningful communication takes time.
Time is on your side. Rushing headfirst into a conversation makes it worse. We’ve all experienced the conversations and conflicts that we look back on and think—”I should have said X”.

To write something up forces you to think things true, solidifies your argumentation, and makes your thoughts clearer. Take the time to write it up. It will end up saving you time in the end.

Don’t expect people to get back to you immediately, unless it’s [a true emergency](link to internal info about this). As Basecamp puts it:

> The expectation of immediate response is toxic. Urgency is overrated, ASAP is poison.  

## 6. Writing helps everyone, speaking only helps the people there with you
When you express your thoughts, you give others the opportunity to understand your perspective and background. Your opinions, thoughts and feelings are one of the reasons why you work here. They are critical to make us better!

When you express yourself speaking, you only extend that opportunity to the people who are there with you. When you express yourself in writing, you give the same opportunity to everyone that you share the text with.

For the times when speaking is the right tool for the job—record it and share the video later. That way you can unlock time for others, just like in writing. Remember that the findability of video isn’t as good as of text.

## 9. Consider where you put things.
The right message in the wrong place might as well not exist at all. When someone has to ask or search to find something, it’s often because it wasn’t where they expected it to be.

Know our communication channels INTERNAL LINK, and understand which one to use for your particular need. If you’re unsure where to put something, default to channels that are more asynchronous, and more persistent.

## 10. Automate when possible
In the excellent book ”Atomic Habits”, author James Clear states:

> we don’t rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems  
Even with the best of intentions we will fail to meet our expectations unless we create a system for them. Use reminders, Slack bots, calendars, etc to automate communication. In the section below on day-to-day communication you can find some ideas for communication automation.

## Respect people’s time
Yes, chat is appealing. In the same way sugar is appealing. And cigarettes are appealing. It provides short term communication pleasure at the expense of long term organizational health. All sorts of things begin to go wrong when groups begin communicating in real-time, one line at a time, all the time.

We’ve also seen strong evidence that the method and manner in which you choose to communicate has a major influence on how people feel at work. Frazzled, exhausted, and anxious? Or calm, cool, and collected? These aren’t just states of mind, they are conditions caused by the kinds of tools we use, and the kinds of behaviors those tools encourage.

Software developers are prone to saying “well, then you’re using it wrong.” Or “it’s not the tool’s fault, it’s how you use it.” That’s a cop out. Tools encourage default behaviors, they dictate patterns and golden paths. These represent the tool makers’ ideal user experiences. If following along breaks your back, then it’s not because you tried to lift too much, it’s because the tool applied pressure in all the wrong places. The wrong defaults can damage morale and defeat organizations.

## The positives of chat
It ain’t all bad. In fact, chat is a great fit for a few things:
### 1. Hashing things out quickly.
When you need to toss an idea back and forth between a few people, there’s nothing better than chat. Toss in some words, drag in a picture, get some quick feedback, and move on (just get out quick before you get sucked back in).
### 2. Red alerts.
Sometimes it’s essential to get critical information in front of people. A server’s down, a deploy failed, there’s a crisis that truly demands a group’s immediate attention. There are a variety of ways to get this instant information to people, and piping it into a high priority chat room or channel is definitely one of those ways.
### 3. Having fun.
Fun at work is as important as work at work. And chat really works well here. Culture develops, inside jokes flow, emoji, cat pics are circulated, and meme generators are perfect territory for the chat room or channel.
### 4. A sense of belonging.
This is particularly important for people who work remotely. Having a chat room where you can just say good morning, let people know you’re out for lunch, and generally just feel part of something is a powerful counter to cabin fever.
